Baseplate
=========

Baseplate is a framework to build services on and a library of common and
well-tested code to share. Its goal is to provide all the common things a
service needs with as few surprises as possible. It can be divided up into
three distinct categories of components, listed below.

The Instrumentation Framework
-----------------------------

Baseplate provides an instrumentation framework that integrates with popular
application frameworks to provide automatic diagnostics to services.

   baseplate.core: The skeleton of the instrumentation framework <baseplate/core>
   baseplate.context: Integration with client libraries <baseplate/context/index>
   baseplate.integration: Integration with application frameworks <baseplate/integration/index>
   baseplate.diagnostics: Diagnostics observers <baseplate/diagnostics/index>

The Library
-----------

Baseplate also provides a collection of "extra batteries". These independent
modules provide commonly needed functionality to applications. They can be used
separately from the rest of Baseplate.

   baseplate.crypto: Cryptographic Primitives <baseplate/crypto>
   baseplate.events: Events for the data pipeline <baseplate/events>
   baseplate.experiments: Experiments framework <baseplate/experiments/index>
   baseplate.file_watcher: Read files from disk as they change <baseplate/file_watcher>
   baseplate.live_data: Tools for centralized data that updates near instantly <baseplate/live_data>
   baseplate.message_queue: POSIX IPC Message Queues <baseplate/message_queue>
   baseplate.metrics: Counters and timers for statsd <baseplate/metrics>
   baseplate.random: Extensions to the standard library's random module <baseplate/random>

   baseplate.secrets: Secure storage and access to secret tokens and credentials <baseplate/secrets>
   baseplate.thrift_pool: A Thrift client connection pool <baseplate/thrift_pool>
   baseplate.service_discovery: Integration with Synapse service discovery <baseplate/service_discovery>

The CLI Toolkit
---------------

Baseplate provides command line tools which are useful for running applications
in production and development.

   baseplate-serve: The application server <cli/serve>
   baseplate-script: Run backend scripts <cli/script>
