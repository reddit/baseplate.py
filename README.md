Baseplate is a library to build services on. Its goal is to provide all the
common things a service needs with as few surprises as possible, including:

* compatibility with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4+
* transparent diagnostic information collection (metrics, tracing, logging)
* configuration parsing
* gevent-based Thrift and WSGI servers meant to run under [Einhorn]
* and various helper libraries like a Thrift client pool
