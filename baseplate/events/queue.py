"""Client library for sending events to the data processing system.

This is for use with the event collector system. Events generally track
something that happens in production that we want to instrument for planning
and analytical purposes.

Events are serialized and put onto a message queue on the same server. These
serialized events are then consumed and published to the remote event collector
by a separate daemon.
