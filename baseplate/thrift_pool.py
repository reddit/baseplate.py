"""A Thrift client connection pool.

.. note:: See :py:class:`baseplate.context.thrift.ThriftContextFactory` for
    a convenient way to integrate the pool with your application.

The pool lazily creates connections and maintains them in a pool. Individual
connections have a maximum lifetime, after which they will be recycled.

A basic example of usage::

    pool = ThriftConnectionPool(endpoint)
    with pool.connection() as protocol:
        client = ExampleService.Client(protocol)
        client.do_example_thing()
