class R2Experiment(Experiment):
    """A "legacy", r2-style experiment.

    Should log bucketing events to the event pipeline.

    Note that this style of experiment caps the size of your variants such
    that:

    .. code-block:: python

        def max_variant_size(variant_size, num_variants):
            return max(variant_size, (1/num_variants) * 100)

    The config dict is expected to have the following values:

        * **variants**: dict mapping variant names to their sizes. Variant
          sizes are expressed as numeric percentages rather than a fraction of
          1 (that is, 1.5 means 1.5%, not 150%).
        * **targeting**: (Optional) dict that maps the names of targeting
          parameters to lists of valid values.  When determining the variant
          of an experiment, the targeting parameters you want to use are passed
          in as keyword arguments to the call to experiment.variant.
        * **overrides**: (Optional) dict that maps override parameters to
          dictionaries mapping values to the variant name you want to override
          the variant to. When determining the variant of an experiment, the
          override parameters you want to use are passed in as keyword
          arguments to the call to experiment.variant.
        * **bucket_val**: (Optional) Name of the parameter you want to use for
          bucketing.  This value must be passed to the call to
          experiment.variant as a keyword argument.  Defaults to "user_id".
        * **seed**: (Optional) Overrides the seed for this experiment.  If this
          is not set, `name` is used as the seed.
        * **newer_than**: (Optional) The earliest time that a bucketing
          resource can have been created by in UTC epoch seconds.  If set, you
          must pass the time, in UTC epoch seconds, when the resource that you
          are bucketing was created to the call to experiment.variant as the
          "created" parameter. For example, if you are bucketing based on
          user_id, created would be set to the time when a User account was
          created or when an LoID cookie was generated.
